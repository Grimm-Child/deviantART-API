How to utilise DeviantArt's feeds as a CMS

---

DeviantArt allows us to create Gallery Folders to organise our deviations: http://fu51on.deviantart.com/gallery/

**If only we could grab the feed for these folders and use it to dynamically populate our website...**

---

What is the URL of the feed?
----------------------------

`http://backend.deviantart.com/rss.xml?q=gallery:[deviant name]/[gallery]`

e.g. http://backend.deviantart.com/rss.xml?q=gallery:fu51on/27123391

What data does the feed provide?
--------------------------------

- title
- link
- permalink
- date
- keywords (doesn't seem to return anything at the moment)
- rating
- category
- deviant's name
- deviant's avatar
- copyright
- description
- thumbnail (w: 150)
- thumbnail (w: 300)
- deviation
